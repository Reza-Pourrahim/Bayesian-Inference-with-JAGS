# Bayesian Inference with JAGS
 Bayesian Inference withJAGS


In this project I've proposed an in-depth fully Bayesian analysis (using MCMC simulation) of some real data taken from R package ‘carData’. I chose an appropriate statistical model to deal with the data. I used JAGS in this project.

JAGS is Just Another Gibbs Sampler. It is a program for analysis of Bayesian hierarchical models using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation not wholly unlike BUGS.
